# MOPITT
A repo for code related to the MOPITT satellite instrument 

MOPITT is an instrument flying on NASA's Earth Observing System Terra spacecraft, measuring tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) on the global scale. MOPITT measurements enable scientists to analyze the distribution, transport, sources and sinks of CO, a trace gas produced by methane oxidation, hydrocarbons released by plants, fossil fuel consumption and biomass burning. MOPITT has been operational since March 2000.
